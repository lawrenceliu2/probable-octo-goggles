<h2>Project: Multiplayer Snakes Stuffs with Networking</h2>

<h2>Development Log</h2>

<b>5/14/16</b>

- DAN: Wrote base snake game

<b>5/15/16</b>

- DAN: Wrote simple network framework with server and client

<b>5/16/16</b>

-NEW BUG: On school computers, the game flashes the game over screen and the snake is unmovable, even though commands are being entered. Client also not connected to server (Daniel managed to actually move his snake but the game over screen persists) Same on Lawrence's computer but game over screen disappears.

-Bug report: The first time Lawrence opened the server and client, said bug occured. However, after restarting both, the game played as usual with no bugs. After restarting yet again, the bug appeared.

-Server should relay information based on number of clients now.

- DAN: Made a ghost snake to test server sided steering. It works

- DAN: Also fixed assignment of -1 ID's

-Server now relays more useful information such as how many snakes are connected, color of each, and how they are moving.
